        The first boss that got infamous is probably "The Bloat". This boss got
        so infamous to the point that someone made reddit page of the boss
        called "Fuck Bloat"<br />The reason for its hate is that you could not
        stand in front of it or on the sides of it, otherwise you would get
        blasted by his brimstone attack. On top of that, he has two eyes that
        keeps going around the room, making the whole fight very hectic.
