      <p>
        The first boss that got infamous is probably "The Bloat". This boss got
        so infamous to the point that someone made reddit page of the boss
        called "Fuck Bloat"<br />The reason for its hate is that you could not
        stand in front of it or on the sides of it, otherwise you would get
        blasted by his brimstone attack. On top of that, he has two eyes that
        keeps going around the room, making the whole fight very hectic.<hr>
        
        Delirium who was introduced in afterbirth, is arguably the most hated boss in the entirety of the game.
        And for a very good reason as well, he encapsulates everything that makes a boss unfun.
        Teleporting constantly so you cant hit him, using moves that makes him invincible,
        attacks that cant be evaded, and so on. It doesnt make it better that he is a requirement for the postnote,
        so if you want to unlock everything, you have to fight it at some point.
        The worst thing about all this is that if you want to be guaranteed to fight him,
        you have to beat "It Lives" in under 30 min, 
        then fight one of the hardest bosses in the game, while having to skip either the chest or dark room to get more items.
        Otherwise, you have a 25% chance to get it when you have beaten The Lamb or ???, and 50% for Mega Satan,
        making even getting to delirium a pain in the ass.
