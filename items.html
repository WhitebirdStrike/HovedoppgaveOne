        So in the case of items, there has been alot of items which was either
        completely useless, or made the game substantially harder. The D10 was
        one of those abysmal items.<br />It had the unique ability to reroll
        enemies. The big problem with this is that it could reroll it from any
        part of the game, making it a detriment early on in the game, and still
        being super risky later on. It could straight up make you loose from the
        first room by using it.<br />This first itteration of the item made it
        completely useless. The itteration of the D10 was not much better in
        afterbirth+. 
        Its new feature would make it reroll enemies with a
        simmular or lower health. It made it less risky to use, but also didnt
        make the situation where you used it any better most of the time.<hr>
        
        Do you enjoy getting sick by looking at the screen and not being able to see anything while playing? 
        Well, then the Wavy Cap is the right item for you!
        This item messes up the screen and music for just some temporary tears up. The more you use it, the harder it gets to see and play the game
        untill it gets borderline unplayable (also, you might get an epileptic seizure even though you dont have the condition).<hr>
        
        The next item is in a simmular vein, exept the seizure part. The item called "Dataminer" messes up the sprites in the room you use the item,
        and gives one stat up and one stat down and gives random tear effects.
        So there is no wonder that this item is practically useless, unless you feel like gambling your stats.<hr>
        
        "TmTrainer" is the most chaotic item in the game by a landslide.
        Basicly, it makes newly encountered items a random selection of 2-3 effects together, this may also be effects that you would not have on any item that exists in the game,
        like spawning enemies or objects, even unused sprites and such. The big problem with this item is that since it has basicly infinite possitibilites,
        that also means that it is a really unstable also. Some items that you pick up just crash your game, or makes so slow that it becomes unplayable.
