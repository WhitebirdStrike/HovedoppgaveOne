      <h1>The binding of isaac</h1>
      <p class="globalText">
        Delirium who was introduced in afterbirth, is arguably the most hated
        boss in the entirety of the game. And for a very good reason as well, he
        encapsulates everything that makes a boss unfun. Teleporting constantly
        so you cant hit him, using moves that makes him invincible, attacks that
        cant be evaded, and so on. It doesnt make it better that he is a
        requirement for the postnote, so if you want to unlock everything, you
        have to fight it at some point.
      </p>

      <p>
        The worst thing about all this is that if you want to be guaranteed to
        fight him, you have to beat "It Lives" in under 30 min, then fight one
        of the hardest bosses in the game, while having to skip either the chest
        or dark room to get more items. Otherwise, you have a 25% chance to get
        it when you have beaten The Lamb or ???, and 50% for Mega Satan, making
        even getting to delirium a pain in the ass. This boss is especially
        nasty for characters such as the lost or keeper as they have very fev
        hits before they die.
