      <h1>Damocles</h1>
      <p>"A kings fortune..., but at what cost?"</p>
      <p>
        Damocles is a extremely risky item that have the ability to turn a bad
        run into a good run, but also completely ruin it. It is an active item
        which makes a sword appear over isaac when he uses the item and the item
        will transform from a active item to a passive item It has the
        interesting effect of doubling all item pedestals, exept from chests.
        Now this may sound broken and all, but the downside is the risky part.
        When you take your first damage after activating it, an invincible timer
        appears, and from that point in the game, you have a 1/10000 chance
        every tick (0,133 seconds) to die, no matter the hearts you have. So now
        you are on borrowed time, and it can fall at any time in a game. The
        later you are in the run, the more likely it is for the sword to fall.
        15 min and 24 sec is 50% likely to happen. This makes this item a huge
        gamble to take and something to take into concideration when you decide
        if you should take it. There is however sitations which is better than
        others. This item is best used in these situations:

        <li><p>When you have extra lives</p></li>
        <li><p>When you have items that protect you from damage</p></li>
        <li><p>When you are playing The Lost or Tainted Lost</p></li>
